            <p>I am a PhD student in CS at Purdue University, studying compilers, advised by Professor <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/~milind/">Milind Kulkarni</a>.</p>
            <p>I am currently working on compiler optimizations for sparse tensor operations. In the past, I also spent some time on speeding up MapReduce using staging compilers.</p>
            <p>During the summer of 2023, I interned at Apple, working on a custom target and runtime for the Swift programming language.</p>
            <p>As an undergrad, I interned with Princeton University for multiple years, on software for High Energy Physics. During this period, I was a core developer of two software projects that found significant adoption in the Physics community - <a href=https://awkward-array.org/quickstart.html>Awkward Array</a>, a library for irregularly shaped tensor computations, and <a href="https://uproot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">uproot</a>, a python re-implementation of I/O for Physics data motivated by interoperability with other existing Python packages. I also made significant contributions to the following LLVM based projects - <a href="https://enzyme.mit.edu/">Enzyme</a>, <a href="https://root.cern/cling/">Cling</a> and <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/">Clang</a>.
            <p>My CV can be found <a href=https://github.com/reikdas/CV/raw/master/academic-cv.pdf>here</a>.
